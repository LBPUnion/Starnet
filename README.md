# Starnet

Starnet is a .NET library for interacting with ProjectLighthouse instance APIs.

## Stub Repository

This is a stub repository. I've committed bare basics for now, which includes basic API methods, unit tests,
and types. Expect a bigger commit once I've had time to implement everything else. In the meantime, feel free
to tinker with the library.
